## Project Overview

The Sign Language Recognition System is designed to help individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate more effectively with those who do not understand sign language. This system utilizes advanced technologies in computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing to translate sign language gestures into spoken or written language in real time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Recognition**: Captures and translates sign language gestures in real time using a mobile device's camera.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a DenseNet121 Convolutional Neural Network for accurate gesture recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be accessible and easy to use, with customizable settings for user preferences.

## Objectives

1. Build a sign language model using an Action Detection powered by DenseNet121.
2. Predict sign language in real time.
3. Integrate the model into a mobile app for sign language translation.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter and Dart**: For mobile app development.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Specifically, the DenseNet121 architecture.
- **MediaPipe Holistic**: For capturing hand movements, facial expressions, and body postures.
- **TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite**: For model training and deployment.
- **Flask API**: For backend services.
